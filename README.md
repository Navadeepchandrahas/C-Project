# Currency Converter Project

## Project Title
Currency Converter Using C Programming

## Objective
The objective of this project is to create a simple C program that converts a given amount in Indian Rupees (INR) into different foreign currencies using predefined exchange rates. This project demonstrates basic C programming concepts such as input handling, arithmetic operations, decision-making, and clean output formatting.

## Project Description
This program allows the user to:
- Enter an amount in INR.
- Select a currency to convert into (USD, EUR, GBP, JPY, etc.).
- View the converted amount based on predefined exchange rates.
- Receive an error message if an invalid option is chosen.

The program uses fixed conversion rates and does not rely on online APIs. It is beginner-friendly, menu-based, and demonstrates key programming skills.

## Technologies Used
- C Programming Language
- GCC Compiler (or any standard C compiler)
- Terminal / Command Line for input and output

## How to Compile
Use the following command:

gcc currency_converter.c -o currency_converter

This will generate an executable file called `currency_converter` (or `currency_converter.exe` on Windows).

## How to Run

### On Windows:
currency_converter.exe

### On Linux / macOS:
./currency_converter

## Sample Input
Example:

Enter amount in INR: 1000
Choose conversion:
1. USD
2. EUR
3. GBP
4. JPY
Enter your choice: 1

## Sample Output
Example output:

1000 INR = 12.05 USD

(Actual values depend on the conversion rates defined in the code.)

## Screenshots
Screenshots of the program output are included in this repository for verification.

## Assumptions
- All exchange rates are predefined manually.
- User enters valid numeric values for INR.
- Only one conversion occurs per program run.
- No real-time currency updates are used.

## Features
- Simple text-based interface
- Multiple currency options
- Clear formatted output
- Basic error handling
- Demonstrates fundamental C programming concepts

## Learning Outcomes
Students learn how to:
- Write structured C code
- Use conditional statements
- Handle user input
- Perform arithmetic operations
- Document projects properly
- Upload and organize files in GitHub

## Files Included
- `currency_converter.c` — C source code
- `README.md` — Documentation
- `IMG_*.jpg` — Output screenshot(s)

## Notes for Instructor
This repository contains:
- A well-written single `.c` program file
- Program output screenshots
- A complete README with compilation and execution instructions
- A correctly organized GitHub submission
